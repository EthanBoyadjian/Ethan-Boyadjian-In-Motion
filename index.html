          <h2>Welcome to my personal website</h2>
          <p>
            I am delighted to welcome you to my personal website, which I built
            myself to share my journey, experiences, and projects. Here, you’ll
            find information about my expertise in engineering and data science,
            as well as the various professional initiatives I have contributed
            to. I hope this site will give you a better understanding of who I
            am and my passion for technological innovation and data analysis.
            Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more!

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Currently in my final year at École Centrale de Nantes, I specialize
            in the DATASIM program, focused on data science, signal processing,
            and statistical modeling. My diverse professional experiences,
            including at SBM Offshore, France Hélices, and Syroco, have helped
            me develop strong skills in engineering and programming. These
            experiences have also taught me how to solve complex industrial
            problems, whether in the field of technological innovation or risk
            modeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my studies, I am passionate about basketball, a sport
            that teaches me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. I am also
            involved in first aid activities, where I have developed a strong
            sense of responsibility and responsiveness. These extracurricular
            activities help me maintain a personal balance and strengthen my
            ability to stay calm and efficient under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I describe myself as optimistic, determined, honest, and curious.
            Always eager to learn and take on new challenges, I approach every
            project with energy and an open mind. These qualities drive me to
            fully engage in everything I undertake, whether in a professional or
            personal setting.
